# AI Recipes Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the AI recipes feature as specified in the requirements. The feature adds a new step to the onboarding process and creates a user dashboard for managing saved recipes.

## Features Implemented

### 1. AI Recipe Generation
- **Service**: Created `utils/ai.ts` with Google AI integration
- **Schema**: Defined structured recipe schema using Google GenAI Type system
- **API Integration**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for recipe generation
- **Context**: Generates recipes based on user's ingredients, utensils, and preferences

### 2. Extended Onboarding Flow
- **New Step**: Added "Your First Recipes" screen (`/onboarding/recipes`)
- **Flow Update**: Modified preferences screen to navigate to recipe generation instead of completing onboarding
- **Completion Trigger**: Moved onboarding completion to when user saves a recipe
- **UX**: Loading states and error handling for AI generation

### 3. User Dashboard
- **Main Screen**: Created `/dashboard` as the main app screen after onboarding
- **Recipe Management**: Display saved recipes with view and delete functionality
- **Empty State**: Proper handling when no recipes exist
- **Navigation**: Updated login/register flows to redirect to dashboard

### 4. Recipe Detail Views
- **Generated Recipe Detail**: `/recipe-detail` for viewing AI-generated recipes before saving
- **Saved Recipe Detail**: `/saved-recipe-detail` for viewing saved recipes with cook functionality
- **Cook Integration**: Uses Supabase RPC function to subtract ingredients from inventory

### 5. Create New Recipe Flow
- **Preferences Screen**: `/create-recipe` with preference management
- **Generation**: Generate new recipes using current ingredients and updated preferences
- **Save Integration**: Save generated recipes to user's collection

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
utils/ai.ts                 # AI service with Google GenAI integration
app/
├── onboarding/
│   └── recipes.tsx         # New onboarding step
├── dashboard.tsx           # Main user dashboard
├── recipe-detail.tsx       # View generated recipes
├── saved-recipe-detail.tsx # View saved recipes
├── create-recipe.tsx       # Create new recipe flow
└── _layout.tsx            # Updated navigation structure
context/
└── SupabaseContext.tsx    # Auth context provider
```

### Key Components

#### AI Service (`utils/ai.ts`)
- Google GenAI integration with proper error handling
- Structured recipe schema with TypeScript types
- Recipe generation based on user ingredients, utensils, and preferences
- Proper enum constraints for difficulty and other fields

#### Recipe Generation Flow
1. Fetch user's ingredients from Supabase
2. Fetch user's utensils from Supabase
3. Fetch user preferences from Supabase
4. Call Google AI API with structured prompt
5. Parse and return generated recipes
6. Display recipes in cards with view/save actions

#### Database Integration
- Recipe saving to `recipes` table with proper JSON structure
- Onboarding completion triggered by recipe save
- Cook functionality using existing RPC function
- Proper error handling for database operations

### UI/UX Design
- **Consistent Design**: Uses existing design system (colors, fonts, components)
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during AI generation
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and fallbacks
- **Responsive Layout**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Card-based Design**: Clean recipe cards with key information
- **Action Buttons**: Clear view/save/delete actions

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Added `.env.example` with required variables:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
```

### Dependencies
- `@google/genai`: Google AI SDK for recipe generation
- `@tanstack/react-query`: Data fetching and caching
- Updated navigation structure in `_layout.tsx`

## File Structure Changes

### New Files
- `utils/ai.ts` - AI service implementation
- `app/onboarding/recipes.tsx` - New onboarding step
- `app/dashboard.tsx` - User dashboard
- `app/recipe-detail.tsx` - Generated recipe detail view
- `app/saved-recipe-detail.tsx` - Saved recipe detail view
- `app/create-recipe.tsx` - Create new recipe flow
- `context/SupabaseContext.tsx` - Auth context
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

### Modified Files
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Added new routes
- `app/onboarding/tastes.tsx` - Changed navigation to recipe generation
- `app/login.tsx` - Updated redirect to dashboard
- `package.json` - Added new dependencies

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Onboarding flow completes with recipe generation
- [ ] Recipe generation works with user's ingredients
- [ ] Recipe saving completes onboarding
- [ ] Dashboard displays saved recipes
- [ ] Recipe deletion works correctly
- [ ] Cook functionality subtracts ingredients
- [ ] Create new recipe flow works
- [ ] Preference updates persist
- [ ] Error handling for AI API failures
- [ ] Navigation flows work correctly

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty ingredients list
- [ ] AI API failure handling
- [ ] Network error handling
- [ ] Invalid recipe data handling
- [ ] Concurrent recipe generation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Recipe Images**: Add image generation or placeholder images
2. **Recipe Rating**: Allow users to rate saved recipes
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter recipes by difficulty, time, etc.
4. **Recipe Sharing**: Share recipes with other users
5. **Offline Support**: Cache recipes for offline access
6. **Recipe History**: Track previously cooked recipes
7. **Ingredient Substitutions**: Suggest ingredient alternatives
8. **Nutritional Information**: Add nutritional data to recipes

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Recipe Caching**: Cache generated recipes locally
2. **Batch Operations**: Optimize database queries
3. **Image Loading**: Lazy load recipe images
4. **Pagination**: Handle large recipe collections

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- Google AI API key stored in environment variables
- Supabase keys properly configured
- No hardcoded credentials

### Data Validation
- Recipe schema validation on AI response
- Input sanitization for user preferences
- Proper error handling for malformed data

### User Privacy
- Recipes are user-scoped via RLS policies
- No data sharing between users
- Secure session management

## Deployment Notes

### Prerequisites
1. Set up Google AI API key in environment variables
2. Ensure Supabase schema is up to date
3. Verify RLS policies are in place
4. Test onboarding flow with real data

### Rollout Strategy
1. Test with development users first
2. Monitor AI API usage and costs
3. Gather user feedback on recipe quality
4. Iterate on prompt engineering based on results

This implementation provides a complete AI-powered recipe generation feature that integrates seamlessly with the existing Chef app architecture while maintaining high code quality and user experience standards.
